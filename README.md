This project aims at interpret and visualize infomation we collect from a specific course at Notre Dame University. In order to analyze the data in terms of clickstream, we use the high-order network algorithm to extract certain click pattern from all the clickstreams and visualize it throught D3 in Javascript. These four graphs are closely correlated and interconnected. We are trying to attain more valuable insight from it.
