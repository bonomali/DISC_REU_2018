This is the linked webpage for the diagrams in d3js_projects

moreau_fys.html:
	This is the linking document to the webpage. It uses the already made diagrams in d3js_projects and thus
	has none of its own javascript files.

moreau_fys.css:
	This is the stylesheet for the entire webpage. Unlike the javascript files, this is entirely independent
	and specific to moreau_fys.html

csv_files:
	These are all the .csv files required to run the webpage. If you change one in a different directory,
	be sure to make a copy here as well!

json_files:
	These are all the .json files required to run the webpage. Like csv_files, if you change one in a 
	different directory, be sure to make a copy here as well!
