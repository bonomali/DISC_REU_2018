This is the linked webpage for the diagrams in d3js_projects/diagrams

moreau_fys_v2.html:
	This is the linking document to the webpage. It uses the already made diagrams in d3js_projects and thus
	has none of its own javascript files.

	This also specifies which data files are being read in to the diagrams.

	Note that a local server is needed to run the program.

moreau_fys.css:
	This is the stylesheet for the entire webpage. Unlike the javascript files, this is entirely independent
	and specific to moreau_fys.html

older_versions_full_webpage:
	This is a directory of all the webpage versions that are no longer being supported. These files may or
	may not work.
